# Selenium_Repo_Tech
This repo contains an automation project where we are automating different browsers mainly chrome,firefox and IE.There are 
different test cases too, in which we are  checking that the page is loaded or not by using its title name . Also, we are 
checking different elements which we are going to use further for automation.

There are some other test cases too which is used to check the success message or warning message generated at the end of 
Signup.Here it is checking that if the signup Id which we are using is already registered or not.

There is one wait class in utilities package which is containg the explicit waits and are called at the time of page load or 
verifying pages.There is one Browser Factory ehich gives the choice of selecting browsers.

Each and every class is having interface to give a basic idea of the project.

Mainly, there are 2 test classes in which one is used for success and failure of message and other is used for all checkers.

Here, exceptions are used to handle the upcoming exception.

Also there is one spreadsheet which is giving the fair view of the project.
